# Change log

This file documents all notable changes to Coral.  This includes major
new features, important bug fixes and breaking changes.  For a more
detailed list of all changes, click the header links for each version.
This will take you to the relevant sections of the project's
[Git commit history](https://github.com/viproma/coral).

Coral version numbers follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
scheme.  As long as we're still in the initial (pre-1.0) development stage,
all new versions must be expected to contain backwards-incompatible changes.
We don't guarantee that they'll all be documented here, but we'll try to
list the bigger ones.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] – 2018-12-11
### Added
  - A `--no-slave-console` switch to disable creation of new console windows
    for slaves in coralslaveprovider. This only has an effect on Windows.
  - User-settable log level via the `--log-level` switch.
  - File logging, controlled with the `--log-file` and `--log-file-dir`
    switches.
### Changed
  - The slave command line interface is now a bit more well-defined.
  - The FMI logger's "category" field is now included in the log messages.

## [0.9.1] – 2018-06-13
### Fixed
  - Issue [#54](https://github.com/viproma/coral/issues/54):
    Too low time precision in CSV output

## [0.9.0] – 2018-04-23
This will be the last release which supports Visual Studio 2013.
### Added
  - A `--no-output` switch in coralslaveprovider, which disables file
    output of variable values.
  - The ability to change or break existing variable connections with
    `coral::master::Execution::Reconfigure()`.
  - `coral::fmi::Importer::ImportUnpacked()`, a function for importing
    FMUs which have already been unpacked.
### Fixed
  - Some minor issues that prevented Coral from being built with newer
    Visual Studio versions (2015 and 2017).

## [0.8.0] – 2017-04-07
### Added
  - Support for FMI 2.0.
  - A `--realtime` switch to enable soft real time synchronisation in
    coralmaster.
  - A `--debug-pause` switch which causes coralmaster to stop at the
    beginning of the simulation, before any FMI function calls, to allow
    time to attach a debugger to the slaves.
  - This CHANGELOG file.
### Changed
  - A negative number may now be given for any communication timeout,
    which will disable the timeout entirely.
  - The default network interface in coralmaster and coralslaveprovider
    has been changed from `*` to `127.0.0.1`.
    (See issue [#20](https://github.com/viproma/coral/issues/20).)

## [0.7.1] – 2017-03-09
### Fixed
  - Issue [#9](https://github.com/viproma/coral/issues/9):
    `coral/fmi/importer.hpp` depends on private header

## 0.7.0 – 2017-02-07
