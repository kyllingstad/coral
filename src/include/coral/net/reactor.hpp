/**
\brief  An implementation of the reactor pattern.

This class polls a number of sockets, and when a socket has incoming messages,
it dispatches to the registered handler function(s) for that socket.
If multiple sockets have incoming messages, or there are multiple handlers for
one socket, the functions are called in the order they were added.

It also supports timed events, where a handler function is called a certain
number of times (or indefinitely) with a fixed time interval.  Timers are only
active when the messaging loop is running, i.e. between Run() and Stop().
